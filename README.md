# Coin-Flip
Coin Flip Game
This is a Python program designed to simulate a coin toss. The user is invited to choose a side (heads or tails), and the program randomly selects the outcome. If the user's choice matches the result, they win the coin toss.

How to Play
When you start the program, you will be prompted to choose either "heads" or "tails".
The program will then generate a random result to determine the winner, and display the outcome.
If your choice matches the result, you win the coin toss. Otherwise, you'll see an "OOF" message indicating a loss.
After each round, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type "yes" to continue or "no" to exit the program.
Have fun and enjoy the game!
